Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
This is an in depth review and analysis of Kickstarter trends, showing factors that resulted in either failiure, success or cancellation

Referring to the data that is displayed will lead you to knowing the optimal asking price, time of year to launch, how many backers and how much donations each to expect among many other useful points of data.

# Challenges Faced
There were not many hurdles faced in the process of doing this assignment. However, the hurdles that were faced were quite tough, and as can be seen still persist in the final project despite my best efforts. The actual gathering and sorting of the data into columns and rows was the easier part, whereas once it came down to putting into a graph that matched the examples that were given is where things did not go as smoothly. Despite this, I beileve the data that has been collected and displayed is still helpful and still easily portrays and helps to understand the information that is needed.

# Results
At least a couple of main conclusions can be made from this data set. First is that rate of success follows kind of a bell curve in the year with sucess peaking in the middle of the year and it levelling off in the beginning and end, with May having the highest success rate. Second is that projects tend to have a better chance at success if they have a lower, more modest fundraising amount. Along with that, if they did want to ask for a high amount of donations, they now also know at which point it is almost guaranteed to fail if asked for too much. While the data for this is extensive, it cannot possibly cover every possible factor that goes into something like this. It does not account for every statistic as well as not for non-numerical pieces of data, such as: How well the kickstarter page is written, how awareness for the project is spread, who they are sharing the word with, what part of the country is she trying to get it funded in etc etc.
